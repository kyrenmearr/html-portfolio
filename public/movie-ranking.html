<h1>The Best Movies According to Kyren</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Treasure Planet</h3>
<p>I think it was really ahead of its time. The cinematography and animation was very awesome and even until now I can still really appreciate it now when I am older. The story is also really great and the lessons it has taught me has been something I have been applying growing up.</p>

<h3>Enchanted</h3>
<p>The discography of this musical movie is really awesome. The songs in this movies are still my favorites to sing until now.</p>

<h3>Tangled</h3>
<p>The song "I See the Light" is perfection. That's it.</p>
